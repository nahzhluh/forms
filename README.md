# Forms - Process Documentation Platform

Forms is a process-focused documentation platform for makers and creators. The MVP enables individual users to document their creative projects through daily reflections and media capture, emphasizing experimentation and learning over polished results.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup ✅

This phase establishes the project structure and core infrastructure for the Forms platform.

### What's Been Completed

#### Technical Setup
- ✅ React + TypeScript project initialized
- ✅ Radix UI + Tailwind CSS design system configured
- ✅ localStorage utilities and data models implemented
- ✅ Git repository with initial commit structure
- ✅ Basic project structure (components, pages, hooks, utils, types, services, storage)

#### Design Foundation
- ✅ Basic component library (Button, Input, Textarea, Card)
- ✅ Responsive grid system with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Journal-like color palette and typography system
- ✅ Custom CSS utilities for consistent styling

#### Data Management
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for projects, entries, and media
- ✅ localStorage abstraction layer with CRUD operations
- ✅ Data validation and error handling
- ✅ Storage size management and limits

#### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Jest + React Testing Library setup
- ✅ Unit tests for localStorage operations
- ✅ Mock implementations for testing

```

### Design System

#### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm, journal-like colors (yellows, oranges)
- **Neutral**: Subtle grays for text and backgrounds
- **Semantic**: Red for destructive actions

#### Typography
- **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Weights**: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700
- **Scale**: Responsive text sizing

#### Components
- **Button**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive)
- **Input**: Form inputs with focus states
- **Textarea**: Multi-line text input
- **Card**: Content containers with headers, content, and footers

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd forms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### Available Scripts
```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm test           # Run tests
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run eject      # Eject from Create React App
```

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices with functional components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

#### Component Development
- Build components using Radix UI primitives
- Use the `cn` utility for class name composition
- Implement proper accessibility features
- Test components with React Testing Library

#### Data Management
- Use the `storageService` for all data operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate data before storage
- Handle localStorage limitations gracefully

### Testing

#### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch        # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --coverage     # Run tests with coverage
```

#### Test Structure
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for localStorage operations
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for user journeys (future)

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2 development:

1. **Core Data Management**
   - Project creation and storage
   - Project listing and navigation
   - Enhanced data validation
   - Error boundaries implementation

2. **UI Components**
   - Project creation modal
   - Project grid/list views
   - Navigation components
   - Loading and error states

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design optimization
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Performance optimization

### Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

### Performance Considerations

- localStorage size limits (10MB)
- Image compression for media uploads
- Lazy loading for past entries
- Optimized bundle size

### Contributing

1. Follow the established project structure
2. Write tests for new features
3. Use TypeScript for all new code
4. Follow the design system guidelines
5. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
