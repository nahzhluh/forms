### Design System

#### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm, journal-like colors (yellows, oranges)
- **Neutral**: Subtle grays for text and backgrounds
- **Semantic**: Red for destructive actions

#### Typography
- **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Weights**: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700
- **Scale**: Responsive text sizing

#### Components
- **Button**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive)
- **Input**: Form inputs with focus states
- **Textarea**: Multi-line text input
- **Card**: Content containers with headers, content, and footers

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd forms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### Quick Start Guide

1. **Create Your First Project**
   - Click the "+ New Project" button on the dashboard
   - Enter a project name and click "Create Project"
   - You'll be automatically taken to the daily entry view

2. **Write Your First Entry**
   - Add your reflection text in the text area
   - Optionally upload images (up to 5 per entry)
   - Click "Save Entry" or press Cmd+Enter to save

3. **Navigate Your Timeline**
   - Use the sidebar to navigate between dates
   - Click "Today" to return to today's entry
   - View past entries in read-only mode

4. **Load Test Data** (Optional)
   - Click "Load Test Data" on the dashboard to see sample projects and entries
   - This helps you explore the interface with pre-populated content
