I experimented with different brush techniques and was surprised by how the colors blended together. The wet-on-wet technique is trickier than I expected, but I love the organic feel it creates. I'm curious about trying different paper textures next time.",

I was frustrated when my greens kept turning muddy, but then I discovered that using fewer pigments and letting the colors mix naturally on the paper works much better. I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up. What worked well was using a limited palette - it forced me to be more creative with mixing. I want to try painting from life next time instead of just swatches.",
