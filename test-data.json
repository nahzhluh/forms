I experimented with different brush techniques and was surprised by how the colors blended together. The wet-on-wet technique is trickier than I expected, but I love the organic feel it creates. I'm curious about trying different paper textures next time.",

I was frustrated when my greens kept turning muddy, but then I discovered that using fewer pigments and letting the colors mix naturally on the paper works much better. I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up. What worked well was using a limited palette - it forced me to be more creative with mixing. I want to try painting from life next time instead of just swatches.",

What worked well was that I could focus entirely on the words and my thoughts without worrying about composition or lighting. I was frustrated at first because I'm so used to documenting visually, but then I discovered that text-only reflection allows for deeper introspection. I want to explore this balance between visual and textual documentation more.",

I'm curious about how this affects my overall creative practice and whether I'll want to return to visual documentation or continue with this approach.",
